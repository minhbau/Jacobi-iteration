This is a Jacobian solver solving tempreature gradient in a metal plate 
modelled by 2D Laplace equation. 

There is a serial and MPI verison of the code. 


BUILD:
There are makefiles for a Cray and non-Cray system (in Pawsey's case, Zeus). 
To build, simply change directory to the desired version and run:
make -f Makefile.CRAY  
or 
make -f Makefile.ZEUS 

The resulting exeuctables should end up in "bin" directory. 


RUN:
The default problem size is set to 2000 x 2000 grid points but can be increased using 
-r and -c parameters as command line arguments. This will increase the heap allocation by the code.
Default iterations are set to 1000 but can be modified using -m command line argument.
